# ml-ol-simulation

This repository contains all code for running a simulation which examines the
effects of ML adoption on organizational learning. All models are based on
the agent-based model developed by [James March
(1991)](http://strategy.sjsu.edu/www.stable/pdf/March,%20J.%20G.%20%281991%29.%20Organization%20Science%202%281%29%2071-87.pdf)
and use the [Mesa framework](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/) (Python) as 
technical foundation.

## Repository structure

The following files are included in this repository:
- `utils/`: Utility functions for agent initialization, metric calculation and
data preprocessing
- `models/`: Here you can find the actual simulation models, separated into
agent and model definitions
- `nbs/`: Notebooks used for testing complex operations, e.g., efficient metric
calculations
- `data/`: Collected data from simulation runs will be saved here
- `/`: installing and running scripts, environment setup (Docker)
